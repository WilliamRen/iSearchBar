An Android app which have a search bar like iphone

If you want to implement this search bar in your project, You need to follow these steps:-
1.) Include the Layout (seach_box.xml) in required layout file.
2.) Extend "SearchBarExampleActivity" class and thats it.

Note:- If you want to perform some task while typing, override the method "onTextChanged".

Love your feedback about it.
